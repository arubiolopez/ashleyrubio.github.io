    <title>My Favorite Beverage</title>
</head>
<body>
 <p>My preferred beverage of choice is coffee but more specifically a de la olla cold brew with vanilla cold foam. De la olla coffee in general has a softer and smoother taste than other coffee beverages in the market. It can be made with the coffee of your choice, but preferably it should be a Mexican coffee, orange peels, piloncillo for sweetener, and cinnamon sticks. The blend of these ingredients creates a rich flavored coffee. This de la olla cold brew tastes great year round during any weather creating a feeling of comfort and home. </p>
